# Personal Website and Portfolio For Nick Houdek

This Portfolio was designed, built and handcrafted with love and care by myself.

### Design Philosophy
The goal of this design was to be professional, but minimal. A single serif font was used for sections and title headers, while a sans-serif font was used for the body and normal content text. The colors chosen were meant to maintain neutrality and invoke a feeling of tranquility while, at the same time, having a single contrasting bright color to highlight and bring attentiong to important links and items.

### Development Philosophy
This site was developed to be fast, responive, and accessible. All HTML semantics, structure, CSS styling, and Javascript functionality was done from scratch. There are no frameworks, libraries (outside of FontAwesome, because they are, indeed, awesome), or plugins. This allows the site to stay lightweight, fast, and optimized. A large goal of this site is to be as accessible as possible, as I think it's an area of Web Development that does not get as much attention as it should.
